# Spring Java Assignment 2

## 1. Working with Annotations

Source Code : https://github.com/affandyfandy/java-jebi/tree/week_04/Week%2004/Assignment%202/Code/lab1

### **`AppConfig.java`**

### **Code:**
```java
package jebi.hendardi.assignment.config;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "jebi.hendardi.assignment")
public class AppConfig {
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Purpose:** 
  This class is used to configure the Spring application context.
  
- **Annotations:**
  - `@Configuration`: Indicates that the class can be used by the Spring IoC container as a source of bean definitions. This is typically used to mark configuration classes that define beans or other application settings.
  - `@ComponentScan`: Specifies the base packages to scan for Spring components (such as `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, etc.). Here, it tells Spring to scan the package `jebi.hendardi.assignment` for beans, enabling automatic detection and registration of beans within that package.

## **`EmailService.java`**

### **Code:**
```java
public interface EmailService {
    void sendEmail(String to, String subject, String body);
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Purpose:** 
  This interface defines a contract for sending emails. It serves as a blueprint that other classes must implement to provide email-sending functionality.
  
- **Methods:**
  - `sendEmail`: The method signature defines a contract that requires any implementing class to provide functionality for sending an email. It takes three parameters:
    - `to`: The recipient's email address.
    - `subject`: The subject of the email.
    - `body`: The body of the email.

---

## **`EmailServiceImpl.java`**

### **Code:**
```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class EmailServiceImpl implements EmailService {
    @Override
    public void sendEmail(String to, String subject, String body) {
        System.out.println("Sending email to: " + to);
        System.out.println("Subject: " + subject);
        System.out.println("Body: " + body);
    }
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Purpose:** 
  This class provides a concrete implementation of the `EmailService` interface. It defines how the email-sending operation is carried out.
  
- **Annotations:**
  - `@Service`: Indicates that the class is a service component in the Spring framework. This annotation is a specialization of `@Component`, used for classes that provide some business functionalities.

- **Methods:**
  - `sendEmail`: Implements the `sendEmail` method defined in the `EmailService` interface. The method prints the email details to the console, simulating the email-sending process. It uses:
    - `System.out.println`: Prints the email details (recipient, subject, and body) to the console.

---

## **`EmployeeService.java`**

### **Code:**
```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class EmployeeService {

    private EmailService emailService;

    // Constructor-based injections
    @Autowired
    public EmployeeService(EmailService emailService) {
        this.emailService = emailService;
    }

    // Field-based injection
    @Autowired
    private EmailService fieldEmailService;

    // Setter-based injection
    private EmailService setterEmailService;

    @Autowired
    public void setEmailService(EmailService emailService) {
        this.setterEmailService = emailService;
    }

    public void notifyEmployeeByConstructor(String to, String subject, String body) {
        emailService.sendEmail(to, subject, body);
    }

    public void notifyEmployeeByField(String to, String subject, String body) {
        fieldEmailService.sendEmail(to, subject, body);
    }

    public void notifyEmployeeBySetter(String to, String subject, String body) {
        setterEmailService.sendEmail(to, subject, body);
    }
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Purpose:** 
  This class provides methods for notifying employees via email. It demonstrates different ways to inject dependencies (specifically, the `EmailService`) into a class using Spring.

- **Annotations:**
  - `@Service`: Marks the class as a Spring service, which means itâ€™s a component that provides some business logic and is managed by the Spring container.
  - `@Autowired`: Indicates that Spring should automatically inject a dependency into the annotated field, constructor, or setter method.

- **Dependency Injection Types:**
  - **Constructor-based Injection:** The `EmailService` is injected via the class constructor. The constructor is annotated with `@Autowired`, allowing Spring to inject the dependency when the `EmployeeService` bean is created.
  - **Field-based Injection:** The `EmailService` is injected directly into the field `fieldEmailService`, which is annotated with `@Autowired`.
  - **Setter-based Injection:** The `EmailService` is injected via the setter method `setEmailService`. The method is annotated with `@Autowired`, allowing Spring to inject the dependency when the setter is called.

- **Methods:**
  - `notifyEmployeeByConstructor`: Uses the constructor-injected `emailService` to send an email. It calls `sendEmail` on the `emailService` instance.
  - `notifyEmployeeByField`: Uses the field-injected `fieldEmailService` to send an email. It calls `sendEmail` on the `fieldEmailService` instance.
  - `notifyEmployeeBySetter`: Uses the setter-injected `setterEmailService` to send an email. It calls `sendEmail` on the `setterEmailService` instance.

## **`EmployeeServiceTest.java`**

### **Code:**
```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
public class EmployeeServiceTest {

    @Autowired
    private EmployeeService employeeService;

    @Test
    public void testNotifyEmployeeByConstructor() {
        employeeService.notifyEmployeeByConstructor("jebi@example.com", "Work Update : testNotifyEmployeeByConstructor", "Here are your work details > ByConstructor...");
    }

    @Test
    public void testNotifyEmployeeByField() {
        employeeService.notifyEmployeeByField("nite@example.com", "Work Update : testNotifyEmployeeByField", "Here are your work details > ByField...");
    }

    @Test
    public void testNotifyEmployeeBySetter() {
        employeeService.notifyEmployeeBySetter("light@example.com", "Work Update : testNotifyEmployeeBySetter", "Here are your work details > BySetter...");
    }
}
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Purpose:** 
  This class provides unit tests for the `EmployeeService` methods to verify that email notifications are sent correctly using different types of dependency injections.
  
- **Annotations:**
  - `@SpringBootTest`: Indicates that the class is a Spring Boot test and should load the full application context. It allows for testing in a real or simulated environment, ensuring that all components and beans are properly loaded and can be tested.
  - `@Autowired`: Indicates that Spring should inject the `EmployeeService` dependency into the test class.

- **Test Methods:**
  - `testNotifyEmployeeByConstructor`: Tests the `notifyEmployeeByConstructor` method. It sends a sample email and prints its details to the console.
  - `testNotifyEmployeeByField`: Tests the `notifyEmployeeByField` method. It sends a sample email and prints its details to the console.
  - `testNotifyEmployeeBySetter`: Tests the `notifyEmployeeBySetter` method. It sends a sample email and prints its details to the console.

Each test method verifies that the corresponding injection method (`constructor`, `field`, or `setter`) correctly enables the `EmployeeService` to send an email using the `EmailService` implementation.

#
### Program Flow

### a. Application Configuration and Bean Initialization

**AppConfig.java** is the configuration class that enables component scanning in the package `jebi.hendardi.assignment`. When the Spring application starts, it scans this package to discover beans annotated with `@Component`, `@Service`, etc.

**Scanning:** Spring finds `EmailServiceImpl` and `EmployeeService` during the component scan and registers them as beans in the application context.
#
### b. Bean Registration and Dependency Injection

**EmailServiceImpl.java** is marked with `@Service`, so Spring registers it as a service bean. This class implements the `EmailService` interface and provides the functionality to send emails by printing the details to the console.

**EmployeeService.java** is also marked with `@Service`, making it a service bean. This class depends on `EmailService` for sending emails and demonstrates three types of dependency injection:

- **Constructor-based Injection:** Spring injects `EmailServiceImpl` into `EmployeeService` through the constructor when the `EmployeeService` bean is created.
- **Field-based Injection:** Spring directly injects `EmailServiceImpl` into the private field `fieldEmailService` annotated with `@Autowired`.
- **Setter-based Injection:** Spring injects `EmailServiceImpl` into `EmployeeService` through the setter method `setEmailService`, also annotated with `@Autowired`.
#
### c. Running the Program

Typically, this kind of Spring application would be run within a context, such as a web server or a standalone application. For testing purposes, we use unit tests to simulate the behavior.
#
### d. Testing the Functionality

**EmployeeServiceTest.java** is a unit test class annotated with `@SpringBootTest`, which tells Spring to start the entire application context for testing.

**Dependency Injection:** Spring injects the `EmployeeService` bean into the test class.

**Test Methods:**
- `testNotifyEmployeeByConstructor()`: Calls `notifyEmployeeByConstructor` on `EmployeeService`, which uses the constructor-injected `emailService` to send an email and print the details.
- `testNotifyEmployeeByField()`: Calls `notifyEmployeeByField`, using the field-injected `fieldEmailService` to send an email.
- `testNotifyEmployeeBySetter()`: Calls `notifyEmployeeBySetter`, using the setter-injected `setterEmailService` to send an email.

## 2. Comparison of Dependency Injection Types

### Constructor-Based Injection
- **Advantages**:
  - Promotes immutability since dependencies are set at object creation and can't be changed.
  - Helps in identifying missing dependencies at compile-time.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Can become cumbersome with a large number of dependencies.

### Field-Based Injection
- **Advantages**:
  - Simplifies injection by directly annotating fields.
  - Reduces boilerplate code.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Makes testing and mocking difficult because fields can't be easily set from outside the class.
  - Less clear what dependencies a class needs from its constructor.

### Setter-Based Injection
- **Advantages**:
  - Allows changing dependencies after object creation.
  - Provides a middle ground by clearly defining dependencies through setters.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Doesn't promote immutability as dependencies can be modified after object creation.

### Recommended Approach
- **Constructor-Based Injection** is generally recommended for its clarity and immutability. It makes dependencies explicit and easier to test and manage.
- **Field-Based Injection** is less preferred due to difficulties in testing and potential hidden dependencies.
- **Setter-Based Injection** is useful when there is a need to modify dependencies after object creation, though it is less common in favor of constructor-based injection.

## 3. Circular Dependency Injection

### What is Circular Dependency Injection?

Circular dependency occurs when two or more beans are dependent on each other, creating a cycle. This means that Bean A depends on Bean B, and Bean B, in turn, depends on Bean A. Such a situation makes it impossible for the dependency injection container to resolve the dependencies because neither bean can be created without the other being present.

### Example of Circular Dependency

Consider the following example where `ClassA` depends on `ClassB`, and `ClassB` depends on `ClassA`:

```java
@Service
public class ClassA {
    @Autowired
    private ClassB classB;

    public void doSomething() {
        classB.performAction();
    }
}

@Service
public class ClassB {
    @Autowired
    private ClassA classA;

    public void performAction() {
        classA.doSomething();
    }
}
```

In this example, `ClassA` has an `@Autowired` field `classB`, which means it depends on an instance of `ClassB`. Similarly, `ClassB` has an `@Autowired` field `classA`, indicating it depends on an instance of `ClassA`. This creates a circular dependency, where `ClassA` and `ClassB` are mutually dependent.

### Explanation

- **Cycle of Dependency**: The dependency graph between `ClassA` and `ClassB` forms a cycle, making it impossible to instantiate one without requiring the other to be already instantiated.
- **Problem in DI**: Circular dependencies cause problems in dependency injection frameworks like Spring, as they cannot resolve and instantiate the beans due to the cycle.
- **Resolution**: To resolve circular dependencies, consider redesigning your classes to break the dependency cycle, or use techniques such as lazy initialization, constructor injection with an `@Lazy` annotation, or a third bean to mediate the dependencies.

### How to Resolve Circular Dependencies

1. **Redesign Classes**: Refactor the code to eliminate the direct circular dependency. Often, introducing an interface or a third class to handle the shared functionality can help.
2. **Lazy Initialization**: Use the `@Lazy` annotation to delay the initialization of a bean until it is needed, helping to break the dependency cycle.

    ```java
    @Service
    public class ClassA {
        private final ClassB classB;

        @Autowired
        public ClassA(@Lazy ClassB classB) {
            this.classB = classB;
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Setter Injection**: Use setter injection instead of constructor injection, which can sometimes help manage dependencies in a way that avoids cycles.

    ```java
    @Service
    public class ClassA {
        private ClassB classB;

        @Autowired
        public void setClassB(ClassB classB) {
            this.classB = classB;
        }
    }
    ```

4. **Use a Mediator**: Introduce a mediator or a service that handles the interaction between the two dependent classes, breaking the direct dependency between them.

By addressing circular dependencies, you ensure that your application is more maintainable, easier to test, and free from complex initialization issues.



### Issues with Circular Dependency
- **Runtime Exceptions**: Spring will throw a `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException` because it can't create beans with circular dependencies by default.
- **Complexity**: Circular dependencies increase the complexity of the code and make it difficult to maintain and understand.

### Resolving Circular Dependencies
1. **Use `@Lazy` Annotation**: Delay the injection of one of the beans to break the cycle.
2. **Redesign Dependencies**: Refactor code to eliminate the need for circular dependencies by rethinking the design.
3. **Use Setter Injection**: In some cases, setter injection can help manage dependencies more flexibly to avoid cycles.

Example using `@Lazy`:

```java
@Service
public class ClassA {
    private final ClassB classB;

    @Autowired
    public ClassA(@Lazy ClassB classB) {
        this.classB = classB;
    }
}

@Service
public class ClassB {
    private final ClassA classA;

    @Autowired
    public ClassB(@Lazy ClassA classA) {
        this.classA = classA;
    }
}
```

## 4. Explain and give examples for some annotations

### @Configuration
Marks a class as a source of bean definitions for the Spring IoC container. Typically used to define beans using the `@Bean` annotation.

**Example:**
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public EmailService emailService() {
        return new EmailServiceImpl();
    }
}
```
#
### @Bean
Indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container. Typically used in `@Configuration` classes.

**Example:**
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public EmailService emailService() {
        return new EmailServiceImpl();
    }
}
```
#
### @ComponentScan
Configures component scanning directives for use with `@Configuration` classes. It automatically discovers and registers beans in the Spring application context.

**Example:**
```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example")
public class AppConfig {
}
```
#
### @Component
Indicates that an annotated class is a "component". Such classes are considered as candidates for auto-detection when using annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning.

**Example:**
```java
@Component
public class EmailServiceImpl implements EmailService {

    @Override
    public void sendEmail(String to, String subject, String body) {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```
#
### @Service
Specialization of `@Component`. It indicates that an annotated class is a "service", originally defined by Domain-Driven Design (DDD) as an operation offered as an interface that stands alone in the model, with no encapsulated state.

**Example:**
```java
@Service
public class EmployeeService {

    @Autowired
    private EmailService emailService;

    public void notifyEmployee(String email, String subject, String body) {
        emailService.sendEmail(email, subject, body);
    }
}
```
#
### @Autowired
Marks a constructor, field, setter method, or config method to be autowired by Spring's dependency injection facilities. It is an alternative to the XML `<property>` or `<constructor-arg>` elements.

**Example:**
```java
@Service
public class EmployeeService {

    @Autowired
    private EmailService emailService;

    public void notifyEmployee(String email, String subject, String body) {
        emailService.sendEmail(email, subject, body);
    }
}
```
#
### @Scope
Configures the scope of a bean. It can be used at the class level or on a `@Bean` method in a `@Configuration` class. Common scopes are singleton (default) and prototype.

**Example:**
```java
@Service
@Scope("prototype")
public class PrototypeService {

    public void execute() {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```
